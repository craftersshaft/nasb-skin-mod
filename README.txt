this was supposed to be a skin loader mod for nickelodeon all star brawl, with insurance that if a skin failed to load it would go back to the default skin. i give up. i am in a blind rage and it's 9:40 pm and i spent my entire day on this Enjoy

NOTE THAT THIS MOD WILL PROBABLY NOT WORK FOR OTHERS ONLINE! THIS MOD IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!

to use, make a folder in BepInEx/CustomSkins/char_(codename for your character) with the naming convention skin_(codename for your character)_whateveryouwannacall it.
add textures to the folder, but make sure you use the same filename as the default skin. obj importing freezes an object at the very center of the stage, so it's currently broken.
press the defend button on the character select to switch skins. (might only work on controller)
